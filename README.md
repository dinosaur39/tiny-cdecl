# Tiny C Declaration Program

This is a C program that analyzes a C declaration and prints out a human-readable description of the declaration. This code has been implemented using a state machine design pattern.

## Usage

Run `gcc cdecl_to_eng_fsm.c -o cdecl_to_eng_fsm && ./cdecl_to_eng_fsm`, then input the declaration you want to analyze in the standard input.

## Notes

`cdecl_to_eng.c` is not well implemented.
